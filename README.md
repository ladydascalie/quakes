This project being in it's infancy, it's a complete war zone.
Please don't hit me with a stick.[^1]

To run it, you will need to:

- make sure you have a `.env` file (an example is provided)
- a working & accessible `mongodb` install

Then simply `go run main.go`.

You may setup your own telegram channel for testing the notifications. But as a default they are turned off.
This is easily controlled via the config package.

However note that you will need a valid token in your `.env` file for that.

[^1]: not entirely true anymore, it is getting better however many things are likely to change, so I wouldn't consider things  to be settled just yet.
